# Go
This is a set of slides hastily put together for a talk at Ruby Auckland about Go in December 2015.

Basically I liberally stole from slides from Rob Pike et al. found here for example: [http://talks.golang.org/2013](http://talks.golang.org/2013)

## Use
This uses the Go tool 'present' to display and run the code. Look at the plain text by opening the go.slide file.

To display properly:
- install go (homebrew: brew install go)
- install present: `go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/present`
- start up present in this directory
- open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:3999/go.slide](http://127.0.0.1:3999/go.slide)
